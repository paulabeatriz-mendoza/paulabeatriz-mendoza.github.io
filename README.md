## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📊 Power BI – Financial Dashboard

#### 🔎 Project Overview
This provides a consolidated, real‑time view of an organization’s financial health, enabling stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends, and make data‑driven decisions. It transforms complex financial data into clear, actionable insights through visualizations such as charts, tables, and summary metrics.

#### 🧩 Business Problem
Financial data was scattered across multiple files, making it difficult for managers to:
- Revenue & Revenue Growth
- Operating Expenses
- Gross & Net Profit Margin
- Cash Flow (Operating, Investing, Financing)
- Accounts Receivable & Payable
- Budget vs. Actuals
- Forecast vs. Actual Performance

The goal was to centralize all financial data and build an interactive dashboard that tells a clear story.
